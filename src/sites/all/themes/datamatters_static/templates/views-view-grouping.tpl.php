 * perfectly okay.
 *
 * Variables available:
 * - $view: The view object
 * - $grouping: The grouping instruction.
 * - $grouping_level: Integer indicating the hierarchical level of the grouping.
 * - $rows: The rows contained in this grouping.
 * - $title: The title of this grouping.
 * - $content: The processed content output that will normally be used.
